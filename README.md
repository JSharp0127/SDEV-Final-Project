# SDEV-Final-Project
My final project for SDEV 140. A general use character creator for Dungeons and Dragons

A work in progress of a character creator for 5e Dungeons and Dragons.
General character creation for beginner players or players wanting a quick made character.

Goal: Allow a player to enter basic information to allow them to have a usable character to 
begin playing in a timely manner.

Less creation time, more play time.
