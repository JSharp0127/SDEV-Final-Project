# SDEV-Final-Project
My final project for SDEV 140. 

A general use character creator for Dungeons and Dragons.

This application allow the user to create a player character
with minimal inputs and ease. The characters are built
using the SRD base rules. A character of any of the base
classes and races can be made up to level 3.

Less creation time, more play time.
